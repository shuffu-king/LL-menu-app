In this final course project, you were tasked with using some starter code, plus your own, to build a page for the Little Lemon app that meets the following requirements:

Retrieves a food menu from a web server using a REST API.

Decodes the elements sent by the server into a suitable Swift struct.

Converts the decoded elements into Core Data format and saves that to the database.

Shows a search box at the top of the food menu.

Has a mechanism that uses the contents of the search box and filters entries, just showing those which contain the string typed in the search box in their name.

Shows the list in ascending alphabetical order.

Includes sorting and filtering that is both diacritic and case insensitive.

Shows an alert panel confirming the order of a particular food for every item in the food menu tapped by the customer.
